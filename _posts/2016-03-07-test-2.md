# Test 2

What happens if I create a new site?  Is it separate or part of another one?
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c3d87d4f-6fc9-433f-afd1-94cb97804da3.jpg)

What I really want to know is how one can certe a stunning dynamic web experience that is made up of several master pages, scrolling down. Similar to twitter boostrap.

If I put in a load of text what does that look like

Do I need to separate each section with an image or graphic?
